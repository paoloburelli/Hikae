iOS client for the [toFy](https://github.com/paoloburelli/toFy) service. It allows to handle multiple shopping/todo lists shared on the cloud.
The lists can be compiled simoultanously by multiple users and each user will receive notifications. The lists are maintained asynchonously synchronised, so that any change on one client is immediately propoagated on all clients.
